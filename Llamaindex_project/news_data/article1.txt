World Leaders Meet to Discuss Climate Change

In New York today, world leaders gathered for a climate summit to address the growing concerns of global warming. 
The conference highlighted the urgent need to cut greenhouse gas emissions, transition to renewable energy, and 
support developing nations in adapting to climate change.

The UN Secretary-General emphasized that immediate global cooperation is critical to avoid catastrophic impacts 
such as rising sea levels, extreme weather, and food insecurity. Several countries pledged new investments in 
solar and wind projects, while others promised stricter environmental regulations.

Activists welcomed the commitments but warned that promises must turn into action quickly. The summit concluded 
with a call for annual progress reviews to ensure accountability and transparency.
